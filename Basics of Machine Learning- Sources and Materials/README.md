### Baseline & Structures of Machine Learning methodologies - Sources and Materials

I  had planned for an one-hour session on the Baseline & Structures of Machine Learning methodologies primarily for the students of Vellore Institute of Technology, as approached by the Google Developer Student Clubs VIT Amaravati.

Developer Student Clubs (DSC) is a Google Developers program for university students to learn mobile and web development skills

In this session, I have tried to cover the primary sources and materials to start off your career in Machine Learning starting from Masters course in different universities,use of Kaggle kernels and Colab Notebooks, most important courser courses to implementing statistical tests in a dataset and performing  some basic methods in Machine Learning like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression etc.

Finally, I have solved a problem using the Linear Regression approach and have shown that MLE solution and the OLS solution converges at the same value.
